# Admin Booking Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds comprehensive admin booking functionality to the college room allocation system with safety measures, audit trails, and bulk operations.

## Features Implemented

### Backend (API)
- **Enhanced Booking Model**: Added admin fields (source, teacher, subject, department, templateId, overrideAllowed, createdByAdmin)
- **Template System**: Created Template model for recurring booking patterns
- **Audit Trail**: Full audit logging for admin actions with snapshots
- **Admin API Routes**:
  - `GET /api/admin/bookings` - Filtered booking management
  - `POST /api/admin/bookings/batch` - Bulk booking creation
  - `GET /api/admin/templates` - Template management
  - `POST /api/admin/templates` - Template creation
- **Safe Delete Logic**: Admins can delete any booking with audit logging
- **Bulk Operations**: Conflict detection, force override, chunked processing

### Frontend (UI)
- **AdminBookingPanel**: Multi-row bulk booking interface
- **AdminRow**: Individual booking row with dynamic building/floor/room loading
- **AdminBookingsTable**: Full booking management with filtering and pagination
- **Enhanced Room Display**: Shows admin fields (teacher, subject, department, source)
- **Admin Controls**: Delete buttons for admins, cancel buttons for owners
- **Department Constants**: Centralized ['AIML','IT','AI','CSE CORE','DS'] definitions

### Safety Features
- **Role-based Access**: Admin middleware protection
- **Audit Logging**: All admin actions logged with IP, user agent, snapshots
- **Conflict Detection**: Time overlap logic with force override option
- **Preview & Confirm**: Admin sees preview before bulk operations
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error reporting

## Usage

### Admin Login
1. Use admin credentials from seed data (e.g., admin_one / admin123)
2. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
3. Click "Open Booking Management"

### Bulk Booking Creation
1. Open Admin Booking Panel
2. Configure rows with:
   - Building/Floor/Room (leave room empty for all rooms)
   - Day of week pattern
   - Time range
   - Department, Subject, Teacher
   - Horizon days (how far to look ahead)
   - Force override option
3. Preview and confirm

### Booking Management
1. View all bookings with filters
2. Delete any booking (with audit trail)
3. Navigate between bulk creation and management

## Technical Details

### Database Schema Changes
```javascript
// Booking model additions
source: { enum: ['user', 'admin', 'template'], default: 'user' }
teacher: String
subject: String
department: { enum: ['AIML','IT','AI','CSE CORE','DS'] }
templateId: ObjectId (ref: Template)
overrideAllowed: Boolean
createdByAdmin: ObjectId (ref: User)
```

### API Endpoints
```
POST /api/admin/bookings/batch
{
  building, floor, room, dayOfWeek, startTime, endTime,
  department, subject, teacher, horizonDays, forceOverride
}

GET /api/admin/bookings?page=1&department=CSE&date=2024-01-01
```

### Bulk Operation Logic
1. Generate target dates based on day-of-week pattern
2. Check for conflicts using time overlap detection
3. If forceOverride=true: delete conflicting bookings (with audit)
4. Create new bookings in chunks with bulkWrite
5. Emit socket updates for affected dates

## Security & Audit
- All admin actions logged in Audit collection
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Booking snapshots before deletion
- Force override requires explicit confirmation
- Protected admin routes with middleware

## Testing
The implementation includes:
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Conflict detection
- Responsive UI design
- Real-time updates via sockets

## Deployment Notes
- Run `npm run build` for production frontend
- Ensure MongoDB indexes for performance
- Configure environment variables (MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET)
- Seed admin users: `npm run seed`

## Future Enhancements (Phase D)
- Background job processing with Bull queue
- Email notifications for deleted bookings
- Advanced metrics and monitoring
- Bulk export/import functionality
- Template-based recurring bookings
